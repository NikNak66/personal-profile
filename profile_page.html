      <h2 class="hyper" id="hyper">my current hyperfocus</h2>
        <p>My university course. Learning html, css and playing around with layout. I want to do this all of the time, I wish I didn't have to do any of the other things like earn money and cook dinner, so I can just read and learn and experiment all day long. I hope this hyperfocus is one that stays forever.</p>

      <h2 class="irrate" id="irrate">what is currently irritating me</h2>
        <p>People describing the act of holding others accountable for the harmful things they say and do as "cancelling".</p>

      <h2 class="social" id="social">a social issue <div class="care">I really care about</div></h2>
        <p>Trans Peoples Rights. Those that seem to be controlling the discourse on this topic are older, and are not at all reflective of our British values, and I am really scared about the implications this is having on our law making.</p>

      <h2 class="buy" id="buy">something I always buy</h2>
        <p>Any thing printed on a risograph, especially a zine or poster art. I love the Riso so much, I even called a leasing company to get one for myself but they never called me back!</p>

      <h2 class="project" id="project">a project taking up all my time</h2>
        <p>Setting up local maker markets. I have started to work on a better website for this organisation I have created. It is live but I have never been happy with it. Now that I have started this course I have started thinking about updating it, and I have also even started altering the html and css in the wordpress theme.</p>

      <h2 class="topic" id="topic">a topic I try to worm into conversations</h2>
        <p>The Danger of a Single Story by Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche.<a href=https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story> Watch her talk about it in this TedTalk.</a></p>
